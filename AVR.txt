Relevant Devices
This section lists the relevant devices for this document. The following figures show the different family devices, laying out pin count variants and memory sizes:

Vertical migration upwards is possible without code modification, as these devices are pin-compatible and provide the same or more features
Horizontal migration to the left reduces the pin count and, therefore, the available features
Devices with different Flash memory sizes typically also have different SRAM and EEPROM
